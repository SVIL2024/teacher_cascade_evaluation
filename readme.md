# Teacher Cascade Evaluation
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Teacher Cascade Evaluation" system, which is designed to evaluate teacher competence based on our data-driven cascaded model. More details can be found in our paper: "Toward Objective and Actionable Teacher Evaluation: A Cascaded ML Approach with SHAP-Based Interpretability".

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.8
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost etc.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/teacher_cascade_evaluation.git

## Usage
open the cascade_model.ipynb file, and run all the cells

## Dataset
To be more specific, the information gathered from the university is systematically saved in a file named teacher_info***.csv, ensuring its easy access and management for further reference and analysis.
